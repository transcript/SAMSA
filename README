README for SAMSA pipeline
--------------------------

SAMSA version 1.0, created winter 2016
Created by Sam Westreich, stwestreich@ucdavis.edu, github.com/transcript/SAMSA

--------------------------

Included files:
	SAMSA_pre_annotation_pipeline.py - runs Trimmomatic, FLASH (if paired-end files),
		prepares raw sequences for upload to MG-RAST
	MG-RAST_API_downloader.py - allows for batch downloads of annotation results files
		from MG-RAST via API commands
	analysis_counter.py - creates a sorted summary of abundance counts from MG-RAST
		annotation results files
	analysis_counter_w-md5s.py - performs the same step as analysis_counter, but 
		maintains the m5nr ID from MG-RAST for transcript identification
	RefSeq_output_reducer.py - consolidates identical organism matches in summary files
	func_data_trimmer.py - removes excess functional annotation data from summary files
	R_organism_script.Rmd - imports organism summary files and performs statistical 
		significance correlations
	R_functional_script_w-md5s.Rmd - imports functional category summary files and 
		performs statistical significance correlations
	long_tail_threshold.py - permits thresholding of summary files at a chosen cutoff
		percentage
	taxonomy_shifter.py - converts organism summary files (initially at Genus level) to
		other taxonomic levels for analysis
	Bacteria_Genus_flattened.tsv - reference database for taxonomy_shifter.py
	md5-R-results_query.py - submits MG-RAST internal IDs for a functional transcript
		file to MG-RAST's API to determine the RefSeq ID
	package_install.Rmd - short R script that installs all necessary R packages.

--------------------------

Dependencies:
	Trimmomatic, a flexible read­trimming tool for NGS data. Documentation and download		links for Trimmomatic may be found here:  
		http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic .	FLASH, Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads, a tool for merging paired end reads. 
		If the sequencing data is not paired end, this tool is not necessary ­ 
		although paired end data is more accurate. FLASH download and documentation 
		links may be found here: https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/FLASH/ .
	R, preferably RStudio, needed for generating graphs and statistical analysis.
	Python - This pipeline was designed to run in Python 2.7 or greater, but less than
		Python 3.0.

--------------------------

The purpose of the SAMSA pipeline is to handle beginning-to-end metatranscriptome
analysis.  Starting with a raw sequenced file in fastq format, it performs cleaning
and removal of adaptor contamination, and then aligns paired-end files (if specified).
The files must then be submitted to MG-RAST for annotation.

After annotation is complete, the results are downloaded, aggregated into summary
files, and then analyzed using R and DESeq2.  The results can be viewed in either
graphical or tabular format, focusing either on organism-specific activity or functional
activity within the sample.

The SAMSA pipeline is designed to run in an environment with Python and R installed.  
It also requires an internet connection, as annotations are currently handled by the
MG-RAST analysis server.  Users of the SAMSA pipeline must have an MG-RAST account
for assigning annotations.

For more information on how each step in the pipeline functions, consult the included
documentation.  

At the time of this writing, the SAMSA pipeline does not have any install routine.  
Each program listed above must be run from the command line, either individually for
each metatranscriptome file or using a bash batch script.  For more details on the
necessary inputs for each program, run that specific program from the command line with
the "-usage" flag, or consult the documentation.
