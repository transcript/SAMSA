#
# Purpose: With proper inputs, this should automatically generate the API calls
# to upload FASTQ/FASTA files for MG-RAST to process.
# HELP: For more documentation on the MG-RAST API pipeline, read at
# http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/api.html

# USAGE OPTIONS
#
#  Note: this tool may be an be run as a stand-alone (will prompt for inputs)
# or with various inputs specified (for pipeline use)
#
#	-Q		Quiet mode (no printing to STDOUT)
#	-A		Authorization string (found under MG-RAST preferences, must be
#				generated every 10 days)
#	-F		File to be uploaded
#	-usage	Prints usage documentation and exits.
